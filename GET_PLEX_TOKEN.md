# How to Get Your Plex Authentication Token

## The Problem
Your Plex token `4RCeUWbo65-5Ezz6myzE` is **expired or invalid**, which is why posters aren't loading. You're getting `401 Unauthorized` errors from the Plex server.

## Solution: Get a Fresh Token

We've created 3 methods to help you retrieve a valid Plex token. Choose the one that works best for you:

---

## üìã METHOD 1: PowerShell Script (Recommended for Windows)

**This is the easiest method if you're on the Windows machine running Plex.**

1. Open PowerShell on your Windows machine (192.168.5.141)
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\path\to\plex-poster-manager
   ```
3. Run the token finder script:
   ```powershell
   .\find_plex_token.ps1
   ```
4. The script will:
   - Search for Plex Preferences.xml in all common locations
   - Extract the token automatically
   - Copy it to your clipboard
   - Show you next steps

5. If found, the token will be displayed in yellow. Copy it!

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

If none of these methods work:

### Check if Plex is Running
- Make sure Plex Media Server is running on 192.168.5.141
- Verify you can access: `http://192.168.5.141:32400/web`

### Check Your Network
- Make sure you can reach the Plex server from your browser
- Try: `http://192.168.5.141:32400/identity` (should return XML)

### Token Expiration
- Plex tokens can expire if:
  - You changed your Plex password
  - You logged out of all devices
  - Your Plex account had security changes

### Get a New Token from Plex.tv
1. Go to: https://www.plex.tv/claim/
2. Log in with your Plex account
3. You'll see a claim code (this is NOT your token)
4. Instead, use Method 3 above after logging in
