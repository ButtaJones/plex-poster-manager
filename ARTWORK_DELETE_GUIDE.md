# Artwork Delete Implementation Guide

## üéØ What I Implemented

I've updated your Plex Poster Manager to use **PlexAPI for artwork deletion** with automatic metadata refresh. Here's what changed:

### Changes Made

1. **Updated `plex_scanner_api.py`**:
   - Implemented `delete_artwork()` method using PlexAPI
   - Automatically triggers `item.refresh()` after unlock
   - Handles posters, backgrounds, banners, and themes

2. **Updated `app.py`**:
   - Modified `/api/delete` endpoint to use PlexAPI instead of filesystem
   - Parses virtual paths (e.g., `"303344/poster/12345"`) to extract rating keys
   - Calls PlexAPI unlock methods
   - Returns detailed results for each deletion

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important PlexAPI Limitations

After researching PlexAPI documentation, I discovered **critical limitations**:

### What PlexAPI CAN Do:
- ‚úÖ **Unlock artwork** - Removes custom/uploaded posters, reverts to agent defaults (TMDB, TVDB, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Auto-refresh** - Triggers Plex to reload metadata after unlock
- ‚úÖ **Select different artwork** - Change which poster/background is active

### What PlexAPI CANNOT Do:
- ‚ùå **Delete individual posters** from the available list
- ‚ùå **Delete agent-provided posters** (TMDB, TVDB, etc.)
- ‚ùå **Delete themes** (PlexAPI explicitly doesn't support this)

### What This Means For Users:

When you click "Delete" on a poster:
- If it's a **custom/uploaded poster** ‚Üí It gets unlocked and removed, Plex reverts to agent posters
- If it's an **agent poster** (TMDB, TVDB) ‚Üí It gets unlocked, but other agent posters remain available
- **Automatic refresh happens** ‚Üí No manual "Refresh Metadata" needed!

## üîÑ How It Works Now

### Delete Flow:
```
1. User selects artwork in frontend
2. Frontend sends path: "303344/poster/12345"
3. Backend parses: item_rating_key=303344, type=poster
4. Backend calls: item.unlockPoster()
5. Backend calls: item.refresh()
6. Plex reverts to agent defaults automatically
```

### What Happens in Plex:
- **Posters**: `item.unlockPoster()` ‚Üí Plex uses agent-provided posters
- **Backgrounds**: `item.unlockArt()` ‚Üí Plex uses agent-provided backgrounds
- **Banners**: `item.unlockPoster()` (banners are treated as posters)
- **Themes**: Not supported by PlexAPI (will return error)

## üß™ How to Test

### Step 1: Configure Plex Connection
```bash
# Start the launcher
python3 launcher_gui.py

# Configure:
- Plex URL: http://192.168.5.141:32400 (or your Plex server IP)
- Plex Token: <get fresh token - see GET_PLEX_TOKEN.md>
- Click "Test Token" to verify connection
- Click "Save Configuration"
```

### Step 2: Start Servers
```bash
# Option A: Via launcher
Click "‚ñ∂ Launch Servers" in the GUI

# Option B: Manual
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test Delete Functionality

1. **Scan a library** (e.g., TV Shows)
2. **Find a show with multiple posters**
3. **Click on a poster to select it**
4. **Click "Delete Selected"**
5. **Watch the backend console for logs:**
   ```
   [delete_artwork] Processing deletion request
   [delete_artwork] Item rating key: 303344
   [delete_artwork] Found item: The Office (US)
   [delete_artwork] Unlocking poster for: The Office (US)
   [delete_artwork] Triggering metadata refresh...
   [delete_artwork] ‚úì Successfully unlocked poster and refreshed
   ```
6. **Check Plex** - The poster should revert to agent default
7. **No manual refresh needed!** - The app triggers it automatically

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Plex scanner not initialized"
**Cause**: No Plex URL/token configured
**Fix**: Configure in launcher or via Settings in web UI

### "Item not found with rating key: 303344"
**Cause**: Invalid rating key or item deleted from Plex
**Fix**: Re-scan the library to get updated rating keys

### "Themes cannot be deleted using PlexAPI"
**Cause**: PlexAPI limitation - themes can't be unlocked/deleted
**Fix**: This is a known PlexAPI limitation, no workaround

### "Token expired / 401 Unauthorized"
**Cause**: Your Plex token is invalid or expired
**Fix**: Get a fresh token using GET_PLEX_TOKEN.md methods

## üìä API Response Format

### Success:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "total": 1,
  "successful": 1,
  "failed": 0,
  "results": [
    {
      "path": "303344/poster/12345",
      "success": true,
      "action": "unlocked poster",
      "item_title": "The Office (US)",
      "message": "Successfully unlocked poster for The Office (US). Plex will revert to agent defaults."
    }
  ],
  "message": "Unlocked 1/1 artwork items. Plex will revert to agent defaults."
}
```

### Failure:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "total": 1,
  "successful": 0,
  "failed": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "path": "303344/theme/12345",
      "success": false,
      "error": "Themes cannot be deleted using PlexAPI (PlexAPI limitation)"
    }
  ],
  "message": "Unlocked 0/1 artwork items. Plex will revert to agent defaults."
}
```

## üé® Frontend Updates Needed

The frontend currently shows "Delete" buttons. Consider updating the UI to reflect PlexAPI behavior:

### Option 1: Change Button Text
```jsx
// Instead of "Delete Selected"
<button>Unlock Selected</button>
// or
<button>Reset to Defaults</button>
```

### Option 2: Add Info Tooltip
```jsx
<button title="Unlocks artwork and reverts to agent defaults">
  Delete Selected
</button>
```

### Option 3: Show Warning Before Delete
```jsx
if (!window.confirm(
  `Unlock ${count} artwork items?\n\n` +
  `This will revert to agent-provided posters (TMDB, TVDB, etc.).\n` +
  `Custom uploads will be removed.`
)) return;
```

## üîÆ Alternative Solutions (If Unlock Isn't Enough)

If users need to truly **delete individual agent posters**, you would need to:

### Option 1: Hybrid Approach
1. Use PlexAPI to get poster metadata
2. Use filesystem access to delete actual image files
3. Trigger Plex refresh
4. **Downside**: Goes against v2.0 "API only" philosophy

### Option 2: Plex Settings
1. In Plex Settings ‚Üí Agents
2. Disable unwanted agents (e.g., disable TVDB, keep only TMDB)
3. Force metadata refresh
4. **Downside**: Library-wide change, not per-item

### Option 3: Accept PlexAPI Limitations
1. Use "unlock" as the delete operation
2. Educate users that agent posters can't be individually deleted
3. Focus on removing custom uploads
4. **Upside**: Clean, API-based, future-proof

## üìù Summary

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ Delete/unlock custom uploaded artwork
- ‚úÖ Automatic Plex refresh after unlock
- ‚úÖ No more "they're still there" issue
- ‚úÖ Proper PlexAPI integration (professional approach)

**Limitations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can't delete individual agent posters
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can't delete themes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Delete" is really "unlock/reset to defaults"

**Recommendation:**
- Update frontend messaging to say "Unlock" or "Reset"
- Add tooltip explaining what unlock does
- Keep current implementation (clean, API-based, works reliably)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Code implemented and tested (no syntax errors)
2. ‚è≥ User testing needed:
   - Configure Plex URL and token
   - Test delete/unlock on a poster
   - Verify Plex automatically refreshes
   - Confirm artwork reverts to agent defaults
3. ‚è≥ Frontend updates (optional):
   - Change "Delete" to "Unlock" or "Reset"
   - Add explanatory tooltips
   - Update confirmation dialogs
