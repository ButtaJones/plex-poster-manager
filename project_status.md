## Application Architecture

### Backend (`/backend/`)
- **app.py** - Flask REST API server
- **plex_scanner.py** - Plex metadata scanning logic
- **file_manager.py** - File operations and backup management
- **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies

### Frontend (`/frontend/`)
- **src/App.jsx** - Main application component
- **src/api.js** - Backend API client
- **src/components/** - React UI components
  - ArtworkCard.jsx
  - ItemCard.jsx
  - ConfigModal.jsx

---

## How to Start the Application

### Method 1: GUI Launcher (Recommended) üöÄ
```bash
cd /Users/butta/development/plex-poster-manager
python3 launcher_gui.py
```
- Click "‚ñ∂ Launch Servers" to start both backend and frontend
- Browser auto-opens to http://localhost:3000
- Stop with "‚èπ Stop Servers" button

### Method 2: Manual Start (Advanced)

**Terminal 1: Backend Server**
```bash
cd /Users/butta/development/plex-poster-manager/backend
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```
Server will start on http://localhost:5000

**Terminal 2: Frontend Development Server**
```bash
cd /Users/butta/development/plex-poster-manager/frontend
npm start
```
Frontend will open at http://localhost:3000

---

## Configuration Required

### First-Time Setup Steps

1. Start both backend and frontend servers
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
3. Click the settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the top right
4. **IMPORTANT:** Since Plex server is on Windows, you'll need to manually configure the path:
   - Example Windows path: `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server\Metadata\TV Shows`
   - Or map the Windows network share to macOS and provide the local mount path

### Cross-Platform Configuration Notes

Since you're building on macOS but Plex runs on Windows:
- Auto-detect may not work properly
- You'll need to manually enter the Windows Plex metadata path
- Consider setting up network share access from macOS to Windows Plex server
- Alternative: Run the app directly on the Windows machine

## Production Readiness Checklist

### Completed ‚úÖ
- [x] Backend dependencies installed
- [x] Frontend dependencies installed
- [x] Backend server starts without errors
- [x] Frontend builds successfully
- [x] Git repository initialized
- [x] .gitignore properly configured
- [x] No sensitive data in repository
- [x] **ESLint warning fixed** - useCallback properly implemented
- [x] **npm security vulnerabilities reviewed** - dev dependencies only, safe for local dev
- [x] **GUI Launcher created** - One-click start/stop with tkinter

### Needs Attention Before Production

#### High Priority
- [ ] Configure Plex metadata path for your Windows server
- [ ] Test end-to-end scanning functionality with actual Plex data
- [ ] Verify backup system works correctly
- [ ] Test deletion and undo operations with real artwork

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] Consider using production WSGI server instead of Flask development server (e.g., Gunicorn)
- [ ] Add environment variable configuration for production settings
- [ ] Set up HTTPS if exposing publicly
- [ ] Add authentication if needed
- [ ] Create systemd/launchd services for auto-start

#### Low Priority
- [ ] Update deprecated npm packages
- [ ] Add automated tests
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create Docker containers for easier deployment

## Known Issues

### Frontend
1. **ESLint Warning:** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Was: App.jsx:22 - `loadConfig` missing from useEffect dependencies
   - Fix Applied: Wrapped `loadConfig` in `useCallback` and added to dependency array
   - Status: Resolved

2. **Security Vulnerabilities:** ‚úÖ REVIEWED
   - 9 npm vulnerabilities (3 moderate, 6 high) in development dependencies only
   - Impact: Low - Affects react-scripts and webpack-dev-server (dev tools only)
   - Status: Acceptable for local development
   - Action: Not blocking for current use case

### Backend
1. **Development Server Warning:** Flask development server not for production
   - Impact: High (for production deployments)
   - Status: Expected for development
   - Fix: Use Gunicorn or similar WSGI server for production

### Cross-Platform
1. **Path Configuration:** Auto-detect won't work for remote Windows server
   - Impact: High
   - Status: Design limitation
   - Workaround: Manual path configuration required

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before First Use)
1. Configure Windows Plex metadata path in app settings
2. Test scanning a small library
3. Verify backup creation works
4. Test deletion with a non-critical file

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Fix ESLint warning in App.jsx
2. Review npm security vulnerabilities
3. Test all API endpoints thoroughly
4. Document your specific Windows path configuration

### Long Term (Before Production Release)
1. Add authentication/authorization
2. Set up production-grade server (Gunicorn)
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Create deployment documentation
5. Set up monitoring and logging
